JLMD ++

A port of Axel Kohlmeyer's LJMD code written in CPP with the
spirit of the LAMMPS coding model.

Original LJMD code: http://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/ljmd

The goals of this project are the following:

1. Use a simple problem to illustrate parallelism and appropirate implementation in cpp.
2. Help people unfamiliar with C++ get acquainted in a non-intimidating way.
3. Help people unfamiliar with MD get acquainted in a non-intimidating way.
4. Compare timings between codes with additional/variable levels of overhead/abstraction.
5. Include many comments so as to be readable and understandable to novices.
6. Retain the basic idea in LJMD, but use the CPP paradigms found in the LAMMPS code.
